You will be interacting with an OpenShift environment that is running on a 
public cloud. The environment consists of the following systems:

* Master node(s)
* Infrastructure node(s)
* Worker or "application" nodes
* An NFS server

The infrastructure node is providing several services:

* Gogs git server
* This lab manual
* The OpenShift container registry
* The OpenShift router

Additionally, a predefined number of user accounts have been provisioned.

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. 
Some of the command blocks can be executed directly by clicking on them.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
echo "execute in terminal 1"
----

Others will require modification of the command before execution. If you see a command block with 
this "copy and edit" icon

the command will require modification. Clicking it will copy it to the clipboard. You can paste and edit it in the terminal before executing it. 

Typically this is a substitution of your username or user number:

[source,bash,role=copy-and-edit]
----
some command for {{ username }}
----
